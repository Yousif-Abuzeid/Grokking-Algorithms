# Divide & Conquer

Divide and Conquer is a technique to solve problems by dividing them into smaller sub-problems. It is a recursive approach to solve problems. It is a top-down approach. It is a very powerful technique. It is used to solve many problems. It is used to solve problems like sorting, searching, matrix multiplication, etc.

### Divide and Conquer Algorithm

1. Divide the problem into smaller sub-problems.

2. Conquer the sub-problems by solving them recursively.

3. Combine the solutions of the sub-problems to solve the original problem.

### Example

Let's take an example of binary search. Binary search is a divide and conquer algorithm. It is used to search for an element in a sorted array. The steps of binary search are as follows:

1. Find the middle element of the array.

2. If the middle element is equal to the element to be searched, return the index of the middle element.

3. If the middle element is less than the element to be searched, search in the right half of the array.

4. If the middle element is greater than the element to be searched, search in the left half of the array.

5. Repeat the above steps until the element is found or the array is empty.

### Example

Let's take an example of merge sort. Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It is used to sort an array. The steps of merge sort are as follows:

1. Divide the array into two halves.

2. Sort the two halves recursively.

3. Merge the two sorted halves.

## Quick Sort

Let's take an example of quick sort. Quick sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It is used to sort an array. The steps of quick sort are as follows:

1. Choose a pivot element.

2. Partition the array into two halves such that all elements less than the pivot are on the left and all elements greater than the pivot are on the right.

3. Sort the two halves recursively.

4. Combine the two sorted halves.
